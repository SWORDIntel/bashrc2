# ~/bashrc.postcustom
# Last Edit: 06/04/2013
#
# This file is included very last after running bashrc. 
# You can use this to change things like environment variables set
# earlier. The idea is you can edit this file and it's companion
# file bashrc.precustom to change the behavior of bashrc without
# needing to edit the distributed version


# Example: setting your own PROMPT instead of using the one set
# by bashrc
# export PS1=
